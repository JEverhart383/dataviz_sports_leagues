# dataviz_sports_leagues
This is a repo for a quick data viz of the top ten international sports leagues. I used [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [TauCharts](http://www.taucharts.com/) as visualization libraries. All json data was collected and cleaned from the [Global Sports Salary Survey by Sporting Intelligence](http://www.globalsportssalaries.com/GSSS%202014.pdf). 

Things to do: 
+Clean and add other data
+Create additional visualizations
